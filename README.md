# Flask-Parsing-JSON-data
The will explain how to parse and use JSON data from a POST request in Flask, a micro web framework for Python.

## Testing 
We can test this code by using [Postman][1] , which allows us to do POST requests very easily. After installing this Chrome extension, open it and, on the request tab, select the POST method from the dropdown.

On the URL, use http://127.0.0.1:5000/postjson . So, we are using our machineâ€™s loopback IP and the 8090 port we specified in the Python code. Then, click in the Body separator, so we can specify our JSON content.
